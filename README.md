Machine learning algorithms are computational methods that use input data to learn and make predictions or decisions without relying on a predetermined equation as a model [1][2]. These algorithms can take a variety of forms, such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and naive Bayes algorithms. They use data to build a model and make predictions or classifications, and are often used to automate processes, such as recognizing patterns in data or making decisions.
